There are\n\t * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n\t * stored.

The method's argument\n\t * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n\t * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message.

There are\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n * stored. Whenever one of these limits is exceeded the <tt>LogCollector</tt>\n * will use the <tt>logStorage</tt> object given as an argument to save\n * the batch log entry.\n *\n * @param {Object} logStorage an object which allows to store the logs collected\n * @param {function(string|object[])} logStorage.storeLogs a method called when\n * this <tt>LogCollector</tt> requests log entry storage. The method's argument\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\n * the following format:\n * {\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\n * }\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\n * the sequence of \"A\". Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>.
